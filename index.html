		<!-- Introduction -->
		
		<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
		<p> Coffee is the beverage of choice for millions of people around the world. It is a multi-billion dollar industry and gives employment to over 100,000 people every year.Coffee is particular to the brewer’s creativity and comes in various forms of specialities including: cappuccino, mocha, frappe, Irish coffee, espresso and many more. Today, coffee beans are sold by a number of prominent brands throughout the world. The coffee beans are grown and shredded to their finest by skilled farmers around the world.
		</p>
		<p>Coffee is grown in over 80 countries in the world, mainly in the tropics. Some of the well known producers are as follows:-</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Brazil</li>
				<li>Vietnam</li>
				<li>India</li>
				<li>Indonesia</li>
				<li>Tanzania</li>
				<li>Ethiopia</li>
				
			</ul>
		
		<p>However, these are not the top coffee consumers in the world. Most of the coffee produced in the world goes to Europe & North America. Here are the per capita stats for the top ten consumers (It doesnt necessarily specify the volume consumed per country):-</p>
		
		<ol>
				<li>Finland - 12 kg </li>
				<li>Norway - 9.9 kg</li>
				<li>Iceland - 9 kg</li>
				<li>Denmark - 8.7 kg</li>

		<!-- Stuff you should already know -->
		
		<h1 id="already-know">Stuff you should already know</h1>
		<p> Going back in time, we’ve seen that coffee is not just a drink. It is actually a lot more. In the past, people gathered in houses to share a cup of coffee and exchange information. People still do that today. 
			
		</p>
		<p>There is more to what meets the eye though. You'll be surprised to know these facts about coffee:-</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It’s the world’s 2nd largest traded commodity.  Crude oil is first. Coffee trade is worth over $100 billion worldwide.</li>
				<li>Coffee was banned in Mecca in 1511. It was believed to stimulate radical thinking and idleness.</li>
				<li>Coffee stays warm 20% longer when you add cream.</li>
				<li>There are two types of coffee. Arabica coffee was originally cultivated on the Arabian Peninsula, hence the name. Robusta coffee is a more hardy plant but contains double the amount of caffeine.</li>
				<li>The word espresso comes from Italian and means “expressed” or “forced out”. Espresso is made by forcing very hot water under high pressure through finely ground, compacted coffee.</li>
				<li>“Kopi Luwak” is the most expensive coffee in the world.  It comes from Indonesia and is made from beans digested from the Asian Palm Civet. In other words, it comes from cat poop.  It sells for €350 and up per kilo!</li>
				<li>The “Big Four” coffee roasting companies – Kraft, P&G, Sara Lee and Nestle – buy about 50% of the coffee produced worldwide.</li>
			</ul>

		<!-- Coffee Tree -->
		
		<h1 id="tree">Coffee Tree</h1>
		<p> The coffee tree is a tropical evergreen shrub (genus Coffea) and grows between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. The two most commercially important species grown are varieties of Coffea arabica (Arabicas) and Coffea canephora (Robustas). 
			
		<p>The coffee tree has the potential to grow to 100 feet, however it is kept much shorter for ease of harvest. The leaves look similar to the leaves of a laurel bush and the blossoms have a Jasmine like aroma. The average coffee tree produces an annual yield of 1 to 1 1/2 pounds of roasted coffee. It takes about 4,000 hand-picked green coffee beans to make a pound of coffee.</p>
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The average Arabica plant is a large bush with dark-green oval leaves. The fruits, or cherries, are rounded and mature in 7 to 9 months; they usually contain two flat seeds, the coffee beans. When only one bean develops it is called a peaberry.</li>
				<li>Robusta is a robust shrub or small tree that grows up to 10 metres high. The fruits are rounded and take up to 11 months to mature; the seeds are oval in shape and smaller than Arabica seeds.</li>
			</ul>

		<!-- Coffee Beans -->
		
		<h1 id="beans">Coffee Beans</h1>
		<p> Coffee beans are really seeds or pits of the fruit called coffee cherries. These cherries are plump and bright red in color. They look like the cherries we eat, except each cherry normally contains two beans and there is less fruit pulp. An exception is the peaberry, which only grows one bean to a cherry.
		</p>
	
		<p>The coffee cherry has a thin skin with a slightly bitter flavor. Next, comes the fruit, which has a texture similar to a grape and taste quite sweet. The bean is protected by a parchment, which is covered with a slimy layer of mucilage. The coffee bean is bluish green in color and is coated with a thin layer called the silverskin.</p>

		<!-- Altitude & Temperature -->
		
		<h1 id="altitude-temp">Altitude & Temperature</h1>
		<p> The tree grows in tropical regions, between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, that have abundant rainfall, year round warm temperatures averaging 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and no frost. It grows at altitudes ranging from sea level to 6,500 feet and above. It takes about five years for a coffee tree to bear its first full crop of beans. It will then be productive for about fifteen years. 
		</p>
		<p>Growing coffee plants is difficult as the soil warmth is a critical factor, with the optimum temperature hovering at 27.7 degrees Celsius. Propagating the plant through cuttings is equally difficult and requires the maximum of light plus a humidity reading of close to 90%. Rooting can easily take three or four months.</p>
